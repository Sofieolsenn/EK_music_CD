# EK_music_CD
EK Mandatory Assignment: Music CDs
Afleveringsopgave
Create an in-memory front-end application where the user can add music CDs to a table and delete them from it.

No permanent data structure is necessary. The data will be simply stored in the table, thus disappearing upon reload.
The following alternatives to add elements to the DOM could be explored:

createElement()
innerHTML with template literals
cloneNode()
HTML <template>
Notice that all of them have their pros and cons.
